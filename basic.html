        <h1>BASIC Programming Language</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>BASIC</strong> (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) is a family of high-level programming languages designed in the mid-1960s to make programming easier for beginners. It was created by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz at Dartmouth College.
        </p>
        <p>
            BASIC played a significant role in the early days of personal computing, making programming accessible to a wider audience. Its simple syntax and interactive environment allowed users to quickly write and test code, and many early home computers included a version of BASIC in their firmware.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, BASIC has evolved into many dialects, including Visual Basic, QBASIC, and FreeBASIC, and it remains a foundational language for learning programming concepts.
