### Retro Aesthetics: Emulating early internet layouts, styles, and color schemes with pixelated fonts, simple CSS, and iconic design choices that define the web's early years.
### Modern Compatibility: While the project seeks to recreate the old web, it ensures full functionality in modern browsers, offering a nostalgic experience that works seamlessly today.
### Open Source: The repository is open for contributions, allowing developers to participate in bringing the past back to life. Anyone can help by recreating new pieces of the web, fixing bugs, or improving the user experience.
### Purpose & Vision:
